# RISC-V-Processor-Language-used-Verilog-
Implemented a RISC-V processor supporting the RV32I base integer instruction set with a pipelined architecture and hazard handling. Designed a single-port memory system for both data and instructions, optimizing performance with a 2-cycle instruction issuing method to achieve an effective CPI of 2.
